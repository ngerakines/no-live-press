# Installation Notes

```bash
sudo npm install -g express
sudo npm install -g LiveScript
```

# Express

Express could not be installed locally due to NTFSs limited support for symlinks. This approach would have been viable if not for the fact that I creaed this folder while in a Linux VM on a Windows host.

# LiveScript

This project seemsto preer being globally installed. Being a lover and not a fighter, I agreed to comply.
